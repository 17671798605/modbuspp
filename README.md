# MODBUS++  (MODBSPP)   V0.1
MODBUS++ (MODBUSPP) is an open source c++ class/ library making an encapsulation of 
[Modbus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modbus) TCP Protocol published by Modicon 
(Now Schneider Electirc).

MODBUS++ is based on Object-Oriented Programming. While it keeps the efficiency of C++ Code
, it provides a higher level of abstraction than other C Modbus Library. Generally, it is
easier for programmers to use in their development requiring MODBUS TCP Protocol.

## Attention: The code has dependencies on libary on Linux for TCP/IP, if you want to use this in windows, check winsock2 and rewrite portion of code based on socket, Thanks!
